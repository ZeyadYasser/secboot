This directory contains the source code to build a mock EFI binary
for testing. It contains the minimum amount of code to make a valid
EFI binary that just returns 0 and is written in assembler to avoid
depending on gnu-efi to set up a C runtime. This keeps dependencies
to an absolute minimum in order to improve reproducibility.

The NAME variable in the makefile can be specified in order to set
the output filename. The value of this variable is also included in
the compiled binary's .data section in order to make it possible to
produce binaries with different hashes. The default value is "mock".
