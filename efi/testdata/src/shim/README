This directory contains the source code to build a mock EFI binary
that is structured like shim for testing. It contains the minimum
amount of code to make a valid EFI binary that just returns 0 and is
written in assembler to avoid depending on gnu-efi to set up a C
runtime. This keeps dependencies to an absolute minimum in order
to improve reproducibility.

The NAME variable in the makefile can be specified in order to set
the output filename. The value of this variable is also included in
the compiled binary's .data section in order to make it possible to
produce binaries with different hashes. The default value is
"mockshim".

The VENDOR_CERT_FILE variable in the makefile can be specified in
order to include a vendor certificate to the .vendor_cert section
of the binary.

The WITH_SBAT variable in the makefile can be set in order to include
a .sbat section in the compiled binary.
