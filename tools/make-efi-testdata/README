This directory contains a tool that is used to create the test
data in the efi/testdata directory.

It depends on a minimal set of source data (stored in the
efi/testdata/src directory) that includes pre-generated RSA keys,
public certificates, source code for mock EFI binaries and public
dbx updates from uefi.org.

It outputs event logs, EFI variable stores, EFI binaries and
signature database updates for testing.

Note that recreating the EFI binaries and signature databases
is not entirely reproducible because their signatures include
timestamps. This means they are recreated with different file
hashes, but this doesn't affect the actual tests.

Reproducibility of test data is dependent on the environment
in which the data is built. This is particularly true for the
EFI binaries, which are only reproducible when built with the
same toolchain.

This tool depends on make, sbsigntools, gcc and binutils.
